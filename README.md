## What is Hacktoberfest? :thinking:
A month-long celebration from October 1st to October 31st presented by [Digital Ocean](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and [DEV Community](https://dev.to/) collaborated with [GitHub](https://github.com/blog/2433-celebrate-open-source-this-october-with-hacktoberfest) to get people involved in [Open Source](https://github.com/open-source). Create your very first pull request to any public repository on GitHub and contribute to the open-source developer community.
